Class group projects from introductory operating systems course

**Project 1-** Memory Allocation

*This project focuses on solving allocation problems within shared memory or disk blocks. For this project, a class MyMemoryAllocation, which implements the abstract class MemoryAllocation, is created to represent dynamic allocation of memory blocks on a heap following three different strategies: first fit, best fit, and next fit.*

**Project 2-** Virtual Memory Simulator

*This project focuses on virtual memory simulation for 16 bit addresses. An inverted page table is implemented using a hashtable with functions to store addresses into memory and accounts for page faults.*

**Project 3-** Data Parallelism and Concurrency

*In 2004, engineers at Google introduced a new paradigm for large-scale parallel data processing known as MapReduce.One key aspect of MapReduce is that it makes programming such tasks on large-scale clusters easy for developers; instead of worrying about how to manage parallelism and many other complexities common within clusters of machines, the developer can instead just focus on writing little bits of code and the infrastructure handles the rest. This project focuses on building a simplified version of MapReduce for a single machine. A parallel application is created to construct a key-value store of all the words in a large file, where each word is concurrently mapped to a set of values.*
